# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The following script is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Project Instructions:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R script called run_analysis.R provides a series of operations that allow the end user to combine the data from the 
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set into a single table.

The R script is a single script and it will combine the data from the  body acceleration and gravity from the time and frequency measures. The raw data does not contain headers and the script will read them from another file.
